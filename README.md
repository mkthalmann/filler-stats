# Filler Stats

Where I collect the results from the various filler item sets (all in German) that I have run alongside critical material in my linguistic experiments (or in other people's). In the `images` directory, sample visualizations are provided which detail how the various sets are rated on Likert-type scales. The `results` directory contains the raw rating scores. The scripts containing the theme for the visualization and the one that separates the results for the different fillers into dedicated .csv files can be found in the `assets` directory -- though the original data sets are not provided here.

If you would like to take a look at the fillers themselves, please do not hesitate to send me a [message](mailto:maik.thalmann@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20filler-stats).
